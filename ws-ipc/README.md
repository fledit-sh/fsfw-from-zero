# Inter-Process Communication (IPC) with the FSFW

IPC is a necessary tool to let software entities communicate with each other. In general, for
any Software, there are two primary ways for software entities to communicate with each other:

 1. Shared Memory. If memory is shared between threads or tasks, memory access needs to be protected
    with a lock, also commonly called Mutex.
 2. Message Passing. Usually, OSes provide some way of passing messages between threads safely.

√çn this workshop, we will look at both available ways to perform IPC with the FSFW.
I recommend to read the thread and mutual exclusion chapters of the
[the concurrency chapter provided by the isocpp](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp11-library-concurrency)
if you are completely new to concurrency in C++.

# 1. Sharing state between two threads

## Subtasks

1. Create two threads which run some tasks with a period of 50ms using the
   [`std::thread`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread) API
2. Introduce a static global `uint32_t` variable called `SHARED_VARIABLE`
3. Increment the variable in both threads, but ensure that the access
   is protected by a [`std::mutex`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex).
   You can also use the [`std::lock_guard`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock_guard)
   which is a [RAII-style](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) helper object.

# 2. Using messages

C++ does not really have an built-in message queue implementation.
We are going to use a `std::queue` in conjunction with a `std::mutex` to
have something similar to a message queue API.
