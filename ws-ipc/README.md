# Inter-Process Communication (IPC) with the FSFW

IPC is a necessary tool to let software entities communicate with each other. In general, for
any Software, there are two primary ways for software entities to communicated with each other:

 1. Shared Memory. If memory is shared between threads or tasks, memory access needs to be protected
    with a lock, also commonly called Mutex.
 2. Message Passing. Usually, OSes provide some way of passing messages between threads safely.

√çn this workshop, we will look at both available ways to perform IPC with the FSFW.
