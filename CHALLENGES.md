# Getting Started
clone the repo for the tutorial

1. Really Frustrating:
Spending hours on the build file when cloning the repo. correct etl library is important and not in the readme.
Proposal: Add this to the actual repositories.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl.git
cd etl
git checkout <targetVersion>
cmake -B build .
cmake --install build/
```
